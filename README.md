# Parking App
This is a mobile parking appâ€”a complete parking service with finding parking places. 

## Mobile-based Parking App
The increase in city traffic is one of the significant effects of population growth, especially in urban areas. Due to this, searching for a vacant parking area during peak hours is time-consuming and results in wastage of fuel. The drivers keep searching for a suitable parking lot, which increases traffic. As a result, the process of searching a parking lot becomes tedious. The increasing volume of vehicular exhaust creates a  negative impact on the environment. Hence reservation-based smart parking has become the need of the day. In the wake of smart city times, these issues lead us to the need for a smart solution. To resolve these issues and satisfy the increasing demand for parking areas,  parking management organizations are trying to implement better and technologically advanced solutions. A cloud-based smart parking application will enable real-time parking availability monitoring and reservation, thereby providing better services to the end-users and reducing the parking administrator's workload.
